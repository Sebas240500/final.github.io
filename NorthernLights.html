<p> <i> THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis </i>, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere-at altitude for 60 or more than 250 miles-when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field.   The result is a colorful, dancing light show.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily they are much more accessible places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider it anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° in low
  light pollution. Find your magnetic at latitude on NOAA and here.
  <br><br>
  In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field let’s more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating Aurora seasons! I suggest
  autummal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
